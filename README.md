## Introduction

Ninjagoat is an attempt at writing a simple, lightweight, modular, reactive, convention-based, eventsource ready MVVM framework. Oh, and we are writing it in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), so we expect that you will use that, too! If this is not the case don't worry, you can use Ninjagoat anyway, but you will lose part of the fun.

Ninjagoat is currently being developed internally for being used in our single page frontend applications, which require live updates of data coming from a server, and are composed of multiple modules. Besides being developed with [Event Sourcing](http://geteventstore.com) in mind, it can be used also in conventional scenarios.
